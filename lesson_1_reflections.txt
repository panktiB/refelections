because only the changed lines had issues which helped notice and recognize the bug.
we can go view the past versions and understand how its worked in the past and thus help build a better website or app

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
???

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
so that differences in one file are saved along with all the other files together and clubbed making it easier to view how the change looks to the user.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows us the history of the commits of the files and git diff tells us how two versions are different from each other.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
because now i know that even if i make a mistake i can go back to the previous version and not worry that i have forgotten what the code originally was.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
i want to use git to upload my files to the website and get the url for my projects
