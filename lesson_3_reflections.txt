When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
would use a remote repository when i want to push changes to github website and use the website as a place to share my work or specifically
to be able to use the file url.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
because maybe we aren't sure whether we want to include those changes into our work yet. we need to be able to choose whether or not 
we want to include the changes.
