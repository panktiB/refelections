What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
when you initialize a new repo, and empty repo gets created. we may need to add our files to it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
the staging area is where we add files that have a related logical change in them. in the working directory all the files 
are present whether or not they have any change and the repository contains all the files and their history. using
the staging area to decide which files need to be committed is very useful
